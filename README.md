# cos470-finalproject
# This is the final project for COS470. RateMyAirport is a prototype of an app that can be used to rank airports based on personal
# experience. The project should be placed in a directory called RateMyAirport and loaded from there. The directory RateMyAirline
# contains the custom server written in ASP.NET for the app.
